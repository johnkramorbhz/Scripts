# Scripts/ROS Toolbox

## Usage

`ros_tools --compile` It compiles packages in `~/catkin_ws/`

`ros_tools --version` Prints version string

`ros_tools --upgrade` Upgrade this script

## Installation

TODO

## Purpose

Why making this? It requires so many unnecessary steps that I believe it can be automated. ROS does NOT actively look for a package after `catkin_make`.
