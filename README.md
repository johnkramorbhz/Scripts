# Scripts
`deployment` are going to be all scripts that I will be using to install/deploy services.

`unit_tests` are going to be all scripts that I have been used to run unit tests for previous classes

## Note regarding changing name of active branch

`master` is and will be kept for compatibility reasons for some binaries that are deprecated as of migrating branch.
